            You have come to a very special place... a place made for someone truly extraordinary. Someone who is not just cute but absolutely adorable, not just pretty but breathtakingly beautiful, and whose kindness always shines through. Someone who is always there for me, who makes everything brighter just by being themselves.

            If that someone is you... then proceed.

            Happy Birthday, Chevy!

            I wish you an amazing year and life ahead. I love you. Even though it hasn’t been that long since we met, you’ve quickly become one of my closest and most amazing friends—always so caring and thoughtful, and your sense of humor never fails to brighten the day. Not to mention, your talent is truly something special—your writing skills are absolutely incredible.
            
            Beyond all that, I admire you so much and am genuinely proud of you. You have such incredible strength, standing tall and moving forward despite everything that has happened and is happening in your life. It’s inspiring, and it makes me even more grateful to know you. And let me just say, you are absolutely beautiful, inside and out, with a voice that is so pretty it could calm anyone’s soul. I’m so proud of the person you are, and I love you. Here’s to an amazing day and an even more beautiful year ahead! 💖
